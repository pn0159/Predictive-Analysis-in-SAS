# Predicting Effective Wart treatment method using Multiple Linear Regression

# About the project

Applied Multiple Linear Regression model on the Immunotherapy and Cryotherapy datasets to check the effectiveness and results in predicting the effective wart treatment and which one is the best treatment from both 

# Data Source

The Immunotherapy and Cryotherapy datasets used in this project are taken from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository. The datasets are collected along two years from the dermatology clinic of Ghaem Hospital in Mashhad ,Iran. The Immunotherapy with candida antigen and the Cryotherapy  with liquid nitrogen were applied to 180 patients with plantar and common warts. Each dataset contains 90 patients. Patients were randomly selected. The datasets do not have any missing value.
First dataset demonstrated with cryotherapy treatment method with 90 patients and having seven attributes in it with multiple values in it. Seven attributes are: gender of the patients, age of the patients, in how many months a patient be treated, number of warts on patients skin, which type of warts are there, area of skin covered by warts and treatment result after implementation of the cryotherapy treatment.Second dataset demonstrated with Immunotherapy treatment method with 90 patients and having eight attributes in it with multiple values in it. Eight attributes are: gender of the patients, age of the patients, in how many months a patient be treated, number of warts on patients skin, which type of warts are there, area of skin covered by warts, induration diameter (mm2) and treatment result after implementation of the Immunotheraphy treatment.

# Summary

In this study , the most common wart treatment methods, Cryotherapy and Immunotherapy were analyzed for wart treatment prediction by using Multiple Linear Regression model. The experimental result showed an accuracy of 82% and  63% for Cryotherapy and Immunotherapy respectively. Although acceptable levels of success percentages were obtained by this model, it is also possible to achieve better levels of success percentages  for this model using more patient data. From the results I could say that the attributes age, time and type of wart are more related to the response of the treatment. The significance of this study is multifold. First, it will assist the physicians as a decision support tool for wart treatment by cryotherapy .Second, probable side effects  can be avoided for the patients who are supposed to not cure  by this treatment method. Finally, time can be saved, reducing the treatment cost, and improving the quality of treatment. For future research , Regression based robust decision support tool may be developed  for the other wart treatment methods  so that the most appropriate one can be selected  for each unique patient.
